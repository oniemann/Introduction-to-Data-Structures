This directory contains starter code for your project and a
Makefile which can be used to build it.  Begin by copying this
directory int your private volume before beginning work.

The Perl program is not part of your project, but is a reference
implementation.  Your program should produce the same output,
except possibly for minor variations in the format of the error
messages.
